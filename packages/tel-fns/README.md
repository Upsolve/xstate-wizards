# ðŸ“ž tel-fns

`tel-fns` just contains convenience functions/constants for handling phone numbers using the Javascript implementation of Google's phone number lib, called: `google-libphonenumber`. This should probably be it's own repo (why it shouldn't be prefixed with @xstate-wizards), but for conveience sake it's here.

It's API is most definitely going to change and feel more like `date-fns`, but that's for another day.
